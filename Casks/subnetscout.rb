  caveats <<~EOS
    Scan only networks you own or are explicitly authorized to test.

    For admin scans without a password prompt, enable "Come amministratore",
    click "Installa helper…" and approve SubnetScout in System Settings ›
    General › Login Items & Extensions. After an upgrade, click "Reinstalla"
    and approve it again (the build is ad-hoc signed).
